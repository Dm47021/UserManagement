		<h1>User Management</h1>
		<p>User Management is a GUI front end to use the limited multi-user support introduced in Android 4.1 Jellybean</p>
		<p>It allows you to create new users, view existing users and delete users  easily. New usernames can have spaces. Your device MUST be rooted for this app to function properly</p>
		<p>You can reach the developer at <a href="mailto:raghavsood@appaholics.in">raghavsood@appaholics.in</a></p>
		
		<p>For easier function, make sure to check the "Remember" option when granting root permissions.</p>
		
		<p>Scroll down for settings</p>
		
		<h2>Deleting the Primary User</h2>
		<p>Deleting the Primary user is not allowed as it near-bricks your device. See <a href="http://bit.ly/N0cJzt">this</a> for details (XDA)</p>
